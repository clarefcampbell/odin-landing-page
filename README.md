Landing Page Project for TOP

This is an exercise in creating and styling a website based on the provided design. 

I will be starting with a blank slate (fresh html and css) and attempting to recreate the provided image of the end product, included in this repo!

Also included is a provided color and font styles information sheet.

I am considering this project complete. Some things I'd like to do differently in the future are try to take advantage of more html tags like h1, p, etc. Additionally, I'd like to use classes better to be able to condense css.
